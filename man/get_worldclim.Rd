\usage{
get_worldclim(coords, res = 0.5, buff = 0.01, folder = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{Dataframe with x and y sample coordinates.}

\item{res}{The resolution of WorldClim data to download; options are 0.5, 2.5, 5, and 10 arc-minutes (default = 0.5).}

\item{buff}{A buffer area around sample points for cropping the data layers, expressed as a proportion of the spatial extent for the coordinates (default = 0.01).}

\item{folder}{A directory in which to place downloaded worldclim data; if NULL then files will be downloaded to a tmp folder in the working directory (default = NULL).}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster of WorldClim layers.
}
\description{
Download and merge WorldClim data for study area
}
\details{
If res = 0.5 then the individual WorldClim tiles that cover the sample coordinates are downloaded and merged. If res > 2.5 then global layers are downloaded.
The buffer area maintains a large extent for the final cropped data layers around the sample coordinates. e.g. buff = 0.01 creates a 1\% buffer area around the coordinates.
